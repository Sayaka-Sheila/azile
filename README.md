I took questions from Hiroshi Minamishima and asked them a markov-bot. 

Hiroshi Minamishima was a Japanese art critic, contemporary art philosopher, artistic director, and a professor at Joshi Art University.
Minamishima wanted to share his experiences as questions.

Minamishima describes the act of "asking questions" as follows: "I have produced various exhibitions and theatrical performances while asking these constant questions to the artists. Art is an eternal question without an answer. (...) I want to awaken the sensitivity that only exists within you. I am convinced that this is the most important thing for you to do at the beginning of your true artistic life.

He asked those questions mainly to artist friends and students...

I scraped texts from Atsushi Sugita, Miwa Yanagi, Yasumasa Morimura etc. who are his artist friends and students from the net and feeded the markov-bot with it so that he could generate answers to it.
